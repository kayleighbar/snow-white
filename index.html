        <p> Your story begins with your mother, the queen. She sat at the black ebony window sewing, watching as snowflakes fell from the sky. She pricked her finger on her needle and three drops of blood from her finger fell onto the snow. She was taken aback by the beauty of the black ebony window frame contrasting against the white snow and her three small blood drops. She then wished she had a daughter just as beautiful. Not long after, she had you - fitting that description perfectly! </p>
